simulations for grandparent assignment

This repository contains the code and results of error rate estimation performed 
to assess grandparent-grandchild trio assignment with gRandma (https://github.com/delomast/gRandma). 
The methods are described in the manuscript _to be updated_.

The scripts are:

* one_pop_sims_lower_LLR.R: error rate estimation for panels with 400 or fewer loci
* more_snp_one_pop.R: error rate estimation for SNP panels with more than 400 loci
* diff_rel.R: error rate estimation for related trios with the 300 locus microhaplotype panel
* noMiss.R: error rate estimation with no missing data and the 300 locus microhaplotype panel
* make_graphs.R: script to make the graphs in the manuscript
